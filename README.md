# Goll Pairs


A card game about the lives of Yvan and Claire Goll, developed during the Coding Da Vinci Saar-Lor-Lux 2020 hackathon.

# Background

Our card game "Goll Pairs" is easy to play and connects the cards to the digital dataset YvonGoll, creating common ground in a fun way.
Once played, the amazing artworks will remain in people's minds because of the positive and happy memories it imprints during gameplay.
The digital dataset YvonGoll contains a lot of information about the lives of Yvan and Claire Goll, as well as many fantastic drawings, illustrations, portraits and poems.
It was made available by a research collaboration between K8 Institut für strategische Ästhetik and Musée Pierre-Noël de Saint-Dié-des-Vosges. 

# The Game

The game is a browser based game written in HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript 6. You can play it in any modern browser, on a desktop PC, a notebook, tablet or on a mobile device.

# Gameplay

At the start, all the cards are laid face down on the screen. You can touch or click a card to turn them; the objective is to find a pair of matching cards.
For each pair of cards that you match, you will be awarded points. If you complete the game before the timer runs out, you will receive bonus points.
Having points, you will have the option to cheat - To quickely turn a card without taking a turn, or when you already have turned a card, to find the matching card to make a pair.
Doing this however, will cost you points. There is no game-over and each time you win a game, you will be greeted by a lovely message.
The game starts easy, with a deck of just 8 cards but it progresses quickely to a deck of 32 cards.
